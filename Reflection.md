# Reflection Questions

### 1. How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?

- I tried to avoid hardcoding values and instead pass information into my functions so they could be reused for different situations. Using parameters made the functions more flexible because the same logic could work with different names or numbers. I also added simple checks to make sure the inputs made sense before doing anything else.

### 2. What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?

- The hardest part was keeping track of all the conditions and making sure they were written correctly. Small mistakes like missing operators or checking the wrong thing caused errors that weren’t obvious at first. I also had to slow down and think through each possible outcome to make sure the right message or result was returned.

### 3. How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?

- Refactoring helps clean things up and makes the code easier to read and understand. Instead of repeating code or making things overly complicated, it simplifies the logic and I reused functions where possible. This makes the code easier to fix later and less confusing if we come back to it.
